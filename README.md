# Task

### Part 1: Data Preparation  
Your first objective is to merge two public datasets into a single CSV file. The resulting dataset should include the following columns:  
- **Country Code**: Unique and non-missing values only.  
- **Percentage of Individuals**: Relevant data reflecting individual usage or adoption.  
- **Number of Bed-places**: Data representing the accommodation capacity.  

### Part 2: Data Visualization  
Once the dataset is prepared, your next task is to visualize the data. You are encouraged to use creativity in presenting the insights. The visualization can take the form of plots, tables, or a combination of both.  
- Produce **at least one** and **at most three** visualizations.  
- Ensure the visualizations effectively communicate the key findings.  

By completing these tasks, you will provide actionable insights to guide the company’s market entry strategy in Europe.
